# Zoom Clone

A functional and easy to use zoom clone.

Simply copy the unique Room Id, send that to whoever you want to call, and receive the call!

## A few things to note about this current code!!!

Only works, currently, on Localhost, will need to be deployed to an actual server for use outside of localhost. 
Only way to get the code is through the unique ID generated in the Localhost URL. 
If your camera or microphone is not working, you may need to allow it on your browser.

And perhaps the most important part about this Zoom-Clone:
NO MALWARE, NO SELLING YOUR DATA, FREE TO USE

# How to Install

First you'll need to download or clone the github code. If you don't know how to clone Github has their own resources to teach you!
Next you'll also need to download Node JS
    Go to their site and download the latest stable version for your computers operating system

Finally what you'll need to do is, in your command line terminal, navigate to the folder, run the following command:
    npm i

You may also need to install Peer JS
Download it from their website and install it locally across your computer
Depending on your operating system you may need to give special permissions, but if you're trying this from Windows you should be fine

That should install all the needed dependencies to allow you to run it on your computer!

# How to Run

Within your command line, still in the folder, run the command:
    npm run devStart

This should start up the server allowing you to use it.

Next you'll need to open up your web browser and type in the URL: localhost:3000

If everything was done correctly, it SHOULD work and run correctly!
